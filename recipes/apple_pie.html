    <p>This is my mother's apple pie. This is the recipe I use all the time and I love it. I also use a dash of nutmeg
        so if you wish you can put that in too.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Cups Thinly Sliced Apples</li>
        <li>3/4 Cup White Sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon Butter</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon Ground Cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 Recipe Pastry for a 9-Inch Double-Crust Pie</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your pastry for a two crust pie. Wipe, quarter, core, peel, and slice apples; measure to 6 cups.
        </li>
        <li>Combine sugar and cinnamon. The amount of sugar used depends on how tart your apples are.</li>
        <li>Arrange apples in layers in pastry lined pie plate. Sprinkle each layer with sugar and cinnamon. Dot top
            layer with small pieces of butter or margarine. Cover with top crust.</li>
        <li>Place on lowest rack in oven preheated to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce
            oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake for 30 to 35 minutes longer. Serve warm or cold.
